        <p>ï¼¹ou can call me to be a rendering, a visualization, a person who doesn't consider the norms, and it doesn't matter. I just want to express the essential things. They contain my memories, emotions, and nothing more.
        I don't think that someone who worships others doing things can do his own thing. I don't think that people measured by money can succeed, let alone people who don't have the heart can do something that touches others.

        <p>As I began to love myself I found that anguish and emotional suffering are only warning signs that I was living against my own truth.
        Today, I know, this is AUTHENTICITY.
        As I began to love myself I understood how much it can offend somebody as I try to force my desires on this person, even though I knew the time was not right and the person was not ready for it, and even though this person was me.
        Today I call it RESPECT.
