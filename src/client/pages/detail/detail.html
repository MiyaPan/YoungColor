            <p>ï¼¹ou can call me to be a rendering, a visualization, a person who doesn't consider the norms, and it doesn't matter. I just want to express the essential things. They contain my memories, emotions, and nothing more.
                I don't think that someone who worships others doing things can do his own thing. I don't think that people measured by money can succeed, let alone people who don't have the heart can do something that touches others.
